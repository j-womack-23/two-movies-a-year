# two-movies-a-year
Movie list random generator.

For those days when we can't decide what to watch...

This generator is designed to take a tabled set of values from Google Sheets or uploaded CSV, randomize selection of a year, and a column, then provide the output from that resulting cell.

Template/format for CSV or Sheets setup can be found in /templates

This will be accomplished via a python script written by AI, and hosted on StreamLit as a GUI that we can access from our phones. (Possibility of app development later is not off the table...)

Feel free to cop the code once I add a "COMPLETE.TXT" file to the main branch. License is Common, so feel free to use, derivate, and abuse as you see fit. This project will be unsupported unless app development changes, license will remain free regardless.

Thanks
